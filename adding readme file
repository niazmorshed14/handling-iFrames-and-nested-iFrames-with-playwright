## Playwright iFrame Automation

If you've ever worked with web automation, you're likely familiar with iframes. 
Iframes (Inline Frames) are HTML elements used to embed another document within the current HTML document. 
Nested iframes occur when one iframe contains another iframe within it. 
Handling iframes and nested iframes can be challenging in automation testing as it requires switching context between different frames

This repository contains automation code leveraging Playwright, a powerful tool for browser automation, to handle iframes and nested iframes effectively.
