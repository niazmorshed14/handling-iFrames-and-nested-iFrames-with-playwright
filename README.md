## Playwright iFrame Automation

This repository contains automation code leveraging Playwright, a powerful tool for browser automation, to handle iframes and nested iframes effectively. Iframes (Inline Frames) are HTML elements used to embed another document within the current HTML document, providing a means to seamlessly integrate content from different sources.

In modern web applications, iframes are commonly used to embed external content or separate functionalities within a single webpage. However, automated testing and interaction with iframes can be challenging due to their encapsulated nature. This repository addresses this challenge by providing code examples and utilities for handling iframes and nested iframes using Playwright.
